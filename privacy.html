It is not legally binding and should not be used as an actual privacy policy for your website. You must consult with a qualified legal professional to draft a comprehensive, accurate, and legally compliant privacy policy tailored to your specific data practices and applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 8, 2025</p>

            <p>At Tasteluv, we deeply value your trust and are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how Tasteluv ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the Tasteluv.com website ("Site"). This policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by Tasteluv. We believe that understanding how your information is handled is crucial for building a community based on warmth, connection, and transparency.</p>

            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We may collect various types of information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, place an order, subscribe to the newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features, or resources we make available on our Site. The types of information we collect can be broadly categorized as follows:</p>

            <h4>1.1. Personal Identification Information</h4>
            <p>This refers to information that can be used to identify you directly or indirectly. We may collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. This may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name:</strong> When you create an account, comment on a blog post, or submit a recipe, we may ask for your first and last name. This helps us personalize your experience and attribute your contributions.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> This is primarily collected for account registration, newsletter subscriptions, contact form submissions, and for sending you updates, promotional materials (if you opt-in), or important service-related communications. Your email is a key identifier for your account.</li>
                <li><strong>Mailing Address:</strong> If you participate in a contest, order a physical product (e.g., a cookbook or merchandise), or request a physical recipe card, we may collect your mailing address for delivery purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Phone Number:</strong> In rare cases, such as for order fulfillment or customer support, we might request a phone number, but this is always optional unless explicitly required for a specific service.</li>
                <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> If you choose to create a user profile, you might provide additional details such as a profile picture, a short bio, or preferences related to recipes and content. This information is typically optional and designed to enhance your community experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Demographic Information:</strong> While not typically collected directly, if you participate in surveys, we might ask for non-identifiable demographic data (e.g., age range, cooking experience level) to help us understand our audience better and tailor content. This is always optional and aggregated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Users can always refuse to supply personal identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related activities. For example, you cannot subscribe to a newsletter without providing an email address, or create a personalized journal without some form of identification.</p>

            <h4>1.2. Non-Personal Identification Information</h4>
            <p>We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer, and technical information about Users' means of connection to our Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar information. This data helps us understand how our site is used and identify areas for improvement. This information is aggregated and anonymized, meaning it cannot be traced back to an individual user.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Browser Type and Version:</strong> To ensure our site displays correctly across different browsers.</li>
                <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> To optimize our site for various devices and software.</li>
                <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Used for general location data (e.g., country) and to help with security and fraud prevention. IP addresses are typically dynamic and do not directly identify an individual.</li>
                <li><strong>Referral Source:</strong> The website or link that brought you to Tasteluv.com, helping us understand our traffic sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Pages Visited:</strong> Which pages you navigate to on our site, and the order in which you view them.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>This non-personal data is crucial for analytical purposes, allowing us to enhance site performance, user experience, and content relevance without compromising individual privacy. We analyze this data in aggregate to identify trends and patterns, ensuring our site remains a delightful and efficient resource for all users.</p>

            <h4>1.3. Cookies and Web Browser Cookies</h4>
            <p>Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. User's web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. You can find a more detailed explanation in our dedicated <a href="cookies.html">Cookie Policy</a>. In brief, cookies are small text files stored on your device that help us:</p>

                <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> To deliver more relevant advertisements (if applicable) based on your browsing habits, though we prioritize non-intrusive advertising that aligns with our brand values.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Site may not function properly.

                <li><strong>To Send Periodic Emails:</strong> The email address Users provide for order processing will only be used to send them information and updates pertaining to their order. It may also be used to respond to their inquiries, and/or other requests or questions. If User decides to opt-in to our mailing list, they will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. We provide detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email or User may contact us via our Site.</li>
                <li><strong>To Develop New Features:</strong> Understanding user needs and preferences, derived from both personal and non-personal data, helps us innovate and introduce new interactive tools like the "Tasteluv Journal Generator" or "Cook Together" features, enhancing the overall value we provide.</li>

                <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> In certain circumstances, we may be required to use and retain your information to comply with legal processes, governmental requests, or applicable laws and regulations.

            </ol>
            <p>We are committed to using your information responsibly and for purposes that align with the spirit of Tasteluv – fostering connection, warmth, and a love for food. We will always strive to be transparent about our data practices and provide you with control over your personal information.</p>

            <h3>3. How We Protect Your Information</h3>
            <p>We adopt appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information, and data stored on our Site. The security of your data is paramount to us, reflecting our commitment to maintaining a trustworthy and safe online environment for your culinary journey.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt data transmitted between your browser and our servers. This encryption ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials and personal details, is protected during transit, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized parties to intercept.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to your personal data is restricted to employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. These individuals are bound by strict confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments of our systems and infrastructure to identify and address potential weaknesses proactively. This continuous monitoring helps us stay ahead of emerging threats and maintain a robust security posture.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We adhere to the principle of data minimization, collecting only the information that is necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We do not collect excessive or irrelevant data, reducing the risk associated with data storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Anonymization and Aggregation:</strong> Whenever possible, and especially for analytical purposes, we anonymize or aggregate data so that it cannot be linked back to individual users. This protects your privacy while still allowing us to derive valuable insights.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Security:</strong> Our servers and data centers are housed in secure facilities with restricted access, surveillance, and other physical security measures to prevent unauthorized entry and protect hardware.</li>
                <li><strong>Backup and Recovery:</strong> We implement robust data backup and recovery procedures to prevent data loss in the event of system failures or disasters. This ensures that your information remains available and intact.</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> All Tasteluv employees who handle personal data undergo regular training on data privacy and security best practices. This ensures that our team is aware of their responsibilities and equipped to handle your information with the utmost care.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Vendor Security:</strong> When we engage third-party service providers who may handle your data (e.g., payment processors, hosting providers), we conduct due diligence to ensure they adhere to high security standards and comply with relevant data protection regulations. We enter into data processing agreements where necessary to safeguard your information.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> In the unlikely event of a data breach or security incident, we have a comprehensive incident response plan in place. This plan outlines procedures for detection, containment, investigation, notification (where legally required), and remediation, ensuring a swift and effective response to minimize any potential impact.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We continuously review and update our security practices to adapt to new technologies and threats, ensuring the highest possible level of protection for your data.</p>

            <h3>4. Sharing Your Personal Information</h3>
            <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. This aggregated data helps our partners understand our audience without compromising individual privacy.</p>
            <p>We may use third-party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending out newsletters or surveys. We may share your information with these third parties for those limited purposes provided that you have given us your permission. These service providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</p>

            <h4>4.1. Specific Scenarios for Sharing</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information with third parties when we have your explicit consent to do so. For example, if you opt-in to receive promotional material from a specific partner.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We work with trusted third-party service providers who perform functions on our behalf, such as website hosting, data analysis, payment processing, email delivery, and customer support. These providers have access to personal information only as needed to perform their functions and are contractually bound to maintain its confidentiality and security.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Tasteluv, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability. This includes responding to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that Tasteluv is involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. In such a case, you would be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregated or Anonymized Data:</strong> As mentioned, we may share aggregated or anonymized data (which cannot be used to identify you personally) with third parties for various purposes, including marketing, analytics, research, and improving our services. This data helps us and our partners understand trends and patterns without compromising individual privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Media Features:</strong> If you interact with social media features on our Site (e.g., "share" buttons), these features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.

            </ul>
            <p>We are committed to ensuring that any sharing of your personal information is done with careful consideration for your privacy and in compliance with applicable data protection laws.

            <h3>6. Advertising</h3>
            <p>Advertisements appearing on our site may be delivered to Users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.

This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. We strive to partner with advertising networks that respect user privacy and adhere to industry standards.</p>

            <h3>7. Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR & CCPA Considerations)</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data. Tasteluv is committed to facilitating the exercise of these rights. While this is a general overview, specific rights may vary based on applicable laws (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for EU residents, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for California residents).</p>

            <h4>7.1. Right to Access</h4>
            <p>You have the right to request copies of your personal data that we hold. This allows you to verify the accuracy of the information and ensure it is being processed lawfully. We will provide this information in a clear, concise, and easily understandable format. You can request details about the categories of personal data collected, the purposes of processing, the categories of recipients, and the retention periods.</p>

            <h4>7.2. Right to Rectification</h4>
            <p>You have the right to request that Tasteluv correct any information you believe is inaccurate or incomplete. If you find any discrepancies in your profile or other data, please contact us, and we will promptly update it. We are committed to maintaining accurate and up-to-date information to ensure the best possible user experience.</p>

            <h4>7.3. Right to Erasure (Right to Be Forgotten)</h4>
            <p>You have the right to request that Tasteluv erase your personal data under certain conditions. These conditions include: when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, when you withdraw consent, when you object to processing and there are no overriding legitimate grounds, or when the data has been unlawfully processed. Please note that certain data may need to be retained for legal or legitimate business purposes, such as transaction records or compliance with regulatory obligations.</p>

            <h4>7.4. Right to Restrict Processing</h4>
            <p>You have the right to request that Tasteluv restrict the processing of your personal data under certain conditions. This means that we would store your data but not process it further. This right applies when: you contest the accuracy of the data (for a period allowing us to verify accuracy), the processing is unlawful and you oppose erasure, we no longer need the data for processing but you require it for legal claims, or you have objected to processing pending verification of legitimate grounds.</p>

            <h4>7.5. Right to Object to Processing</h4>
            <p>You have the right to object to Tasteluv's processing of your personal data, particularly when the processing is based on our legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes. If you object, we will cease processing your data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. For direct marketing, your objection will always be honored.</p>

            <h4>7.6. Right to Data Portability</h4>
            <p>You have the right to request that Tasteluv transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.

We will provide your data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.</p>

            <h4>7.7. Right to Withdraw Consent</h4>
            <p>Where our processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. This means that if you previously gave us permission to use your data for a specific purpose, you can revoke that permission at any time, and we will cease that specific processing activity.</p>

            <h4>7.8. Right to Lodge a Complaint</h4>
            <p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe that our processing of your personal data infringes applicable data protection laws. We encourage you to contact us first so we can attempt to resolve your concerns directly, but you always have the right to approach the relevant authority.</p>

            <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable laws. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request to ensure the security of your personal data.</p>

            <h3>8. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</h3>
            <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. Tasteluv is not intended for children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us immediately.</p>
