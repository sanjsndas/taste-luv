            <h4>6.1. No Professional Advice</h4>
            <p>The content on Tasteluv.com, including recipes, cooking tips, dietary information, and blog posts, is for informational and entertainment purposes only and is not intended as, nor should it be considered, professional advice. It does not constitute medical, nutritional, legal, or any other professional advice. Always consult with a qualified professional (e.g., doctor, dietitian, lawyer) for advice tailored to your specific situation. We are not responsible for any adverse effects or consequences resulting from the use of any recipes or information on our Site.</p>

            <h4>6.2. Recipe Accuracy and Safety</h4>
            <p>While we strive for accuracy in our recipes and content, we do not warrant that all information is free of errors or omissions. Cooking and baking involve inherent risks. You assume full responsibility for any risks associated with preparing and consuming food based on our recipes, including but not limited to, allergic reactions, foodborne illnesses, or injuries during preparation. Always exercise caution, use proper hygiene, and ensure ingredients are fresh and safe for consumption. If you have any allergies or dietary restrictions, it is your responsibility to verify ingredients and make appropriate substitutions.</p>

            <h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>In no event shall Tasteluv, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose. This limitation of liability applies to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Our aim is to provide a joyful and safe experience, but we cannot be held responsible for unforeseen circumstances or actions beyond our control.</p>

            <h4>7.1. Exclusions and Limitations</h4>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. In such cases, Tasteluv's liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This means that if your jurisdiction does not permit certain exclusions, those exclusions may not apply to you, but the remaining provisions of these Terms will still be in effect. We will always act in good faith and strive to resolve any issues amicably, but our legal liability is limited as described.</p>

            <h3>8. Indemnification</h3>
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Tasteluv and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, by you or any person using your account and password; b) a breach of these Terms; or c) User Content posted on the Service. This indemnification obligation means that you agree to protect Tasteluv from any legal claims or expenses that arise from your actions or content on the Site, ensuring that our community remains a safe and positive space for everyone.</p>

            <h4>8.1. Scope of Indemnification</h4>
            <p>This indemnification includes, without limitation, claims arising from: (i) your violation of any term of these Terms of Service; (ii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; (iii) any claim that your User Content caused damage to a third party; or (iv) your use of the Site in a manner that violates applicable laws or regulations. You agree that Tasteluv shall have control of the defense and settlement of any such claim. We will notify you of any such claim, demand, or proceeding. Your cooperation in the defense of any such claim is required. We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Tasteluv.</p>

            <h3>9. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Country/State, e.g., the State of Delaware, United States], without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>

            <h4>9.1. Dispute Resolution</h4>
            <p>Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Site shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in [Your City, State/Country, e.g., Wilmington, Delaware, United States]. You hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any objection to the laying of venue in such courts. We encourage amicable resolution of any disputes, but this clause specifies the legal framework for formal proceedings if necessary.</p>

            <h3>10. Changes to These Terms</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service. We believe in transparent communication and will always endeavor to inform you of significant changes that may affect your use of Tasteluv.</p>

            <h3>11. Termination</h3>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Site immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. Upon termination, your right to use the Site will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Site or contact us to request account deletion. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.</p>

Tasteluv has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services.

            <h3>13. Severability</h3>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision. This ensures that even if one part of these Terms is found to be legally problematic, the rest of the agreement remains intact and enforceable.</p>

            <h3>14. Entire Agreement</h3>
            <p>These Terms, together with the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="cookies.html">Cookie Policy</a>, constitute the entire agreement between you and Tasteluv regarding your use of the Site and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Site.
